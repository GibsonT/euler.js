Project Euler practice problems in JS.

This was completed as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/), an open-source curriculum for
learning web development. The curriculum GitHub can be viewed [here](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum).

NOTE: I checked a few of the latest TOP solutions and noticed a number of people were having issues with problem 3 calculating the answer with the large number 600851475143.

I figured I'd add in some comments to describe my process to help anyone that may need it. This is FAR from perfect though, so any suggestions to improve on this, or any of the other problems, are more than welcome!
